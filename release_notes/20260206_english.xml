[h2]Twitch Drops[/h2]

We're trying something new during this fest: Twitch drops! Watch Alien Swarm: Reactive Drop on Twitch to get a very special customized 22A3-1 Assault Rifle that tracks your kills, both against alien bugs in co-op and against other marines in deathmatch.

[url=https://link.reactivedrop.com/]Link your Twitch account[/url] to be eligible for drops, then watch [url=https://www.twitch.tv/directory/category/alien-swarm-reactive-drop?filter=drops]any Alien Swarm: Reactive Drop stream on Twitch with drops enabled[/url] for 15 minutes during Steam PvP Fest 2026 to get your prize.

If you miss it, don't worry! There will be more opportunities to earn or craft strange items in the future.</string><string id="subtitle">Play Deathmatch between February 9th and 16th to win a medal!</string><string id="summary"></string><string id="title">Coming Soon: Steam PvP Fest 2026</string></content>
